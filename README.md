# Unity: Value Objects
This package includes ScriptableObject variables and some example scripts on how to implement them.  
The Value Objects are reset to their default value everytime you start the game, but keep their value even on scene change.  
The concept is based on this idea:  
https://unity.com/how-to/architect-game-code-scriptable-objects#architect-variables

The Value Objects are extendable for your own custom types and come with a custom editor that shows you the ingame value.

## How to install
* Open the Package Manager
* Plus-Icon: Add package from git URL...
* Use the HTTPS adress found in "Clone" (https://github.com/KWaldt/value-objects.git)
